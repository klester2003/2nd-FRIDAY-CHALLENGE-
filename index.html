      <div class="Description">
        <p class=>In case you haven't played video games in the last two decades, Call of Duty is a first-person shooter with a substantial team-based component. Call of Duty 
            has had several huge successes over the years (games like Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops are classics), and Activision has now brought that tried-and-true formula to mobile.

        <br> <br>Released in the U.S. in October 2019, Call of Duty: Mobile is exactly what it sounds like — a Call of Duty game that's designed for mobile platforms like Android and iOS. 
        It has all of the core CoD components you'd expect these days, including fast-paced multiplayer, zombies, and battle royale.<br> <br> Call of Duty: Mobile 
        regularly gets new "seasons" that usher in additional characters, maps, and a new Battle Pass.<br> One of the biggest highlights of Disavowed is Cage, which is the first original
         map to debut on CoD: Mobile. It also introduces Soap as a playable character and adds the new H.I.V.E. operator skill that allows you to launch multiple
         proximity mines that release nano drones to attack your enemies.

       <br> <br> With the new Battle Pass, you'll be able to collect the colorful MacTavish skin for the AK117, Urban Tracker character, and plenty of CoD Points, crates, etc. You can obtain
        some rewards with the free version of the Battle Pass, but to unlock all of the rewards, you'll need to spend 560 CoD Points for the Premium Pass.
        <br> <br>Call of Duty: Mobile is a single game you install on your phone, but it has three distinctly different modes that shake things up — Multiplayer, Zombies, and Battle Royale.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h2>
      <div class="Multi">
          <P>This is the classic Call of Duty that you know and love. In this mode, you get together in 5v5 teams and duke it out in a variety of game modes. There's a collection of Core 
              modes that are always available, and these include Frontline, Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Search & Destroy, Domination, Free For All, and Practice vs. AI. <br><br>You'll also 
              find a collection of Featured game modes, which are offered for a limited time and get changed weekly. Some highlights include Snipers Only, One Shot One Kill, Prop Hunt, and Gun Game.

          </P>
        </div>
      <h2 class="Zombies">Zombies</h2>
      <div class="Zomb">
        <p>Zombies has been a staple of the Call of Duty franchise ever since 2008's World at 
        War, and as expected, it returns in CoD: Mobile. However, it's a bit different than the Zombies you might be used to.
        <br> <br> A Survival mode is still available for you to take on endless waves of the undead, but if you want to spruce up your zombie killing with a bit more variety, you'll also find a new Raid 
        mode where you unlock new areas as you progress throughout the game. Work your way up to a final boss that needs to be defeated.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="Battle">Battle Royale</h2>
      <div class="Royale">
         <p>
            Finally, we have Battle Royale. Call of Duty: Mobile's take on BR pits 100 players against each other and is timed to last for about 15 minutes per match. You can play solo, team up with a
              friend for duos, or get a four-person squad together. You also get the option to play in first or third-person, each of which gives the gameplay a distinctly different feeling. <br> <br>
              This is a completely different map that's separate from Blackout and Warzone, so don't expect to be a pro at this just because you've sunk hours into those other Call of Duty battle royale modes.</p>

      <p class="modes">
            --Playing a multiplayer FPS on mobile is a challenge. Having enough real estate to see all the controls needed to play, and the actual combat is a balancing act that some games don't get right. 
            To combat that, Call of Duty: Mobile has two different control modes: Simple Mode, and Advanced Mode.

      <br>
      <h2 class="Simple">Simple Mode</h2> 
      <div class="Mode">
        <p> Simple Mode is a significant departure from the way you would typically play CoD on a console. Instead of having a dedicated firing button, your gun fires when you point the target reticle at the enemy.
             This might sound like a huge advantage, but it isn't. The firing accuracy goes out of the window in this mode, and you rush through ammo at top speed.
             <br> <br>The advantage is you can move and look around much more quickly without having to worry about tapping the screen to get your gun to fire. After all, there are no shoulder buttons on a smartphone, 
             so you only have your thumbs to work with. There's also a setting to limit the distance that auto-aim happens when firing from the hip. You don't want to be wasting shotgun shells when the enemy is too far away.</p>

        <p class="H">Being able to customize your character's inventory has been a staple of the game for many years. Customization is front and center in Call of Duty: Mobile, so without further ado, here's
           what you can expect in these regards.
